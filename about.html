    <h3>What is a Digital Financial Twin?</h3>
    <p>
        A Digital Financial Twin is a virtual representation of an individual’s
        financial life. It mirrors income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and goals
        to create a realistic financial model.
    </p>
    <p>
        FinTwin uses this model to simulate decisions and analyze outcomes
        before they happen in real life.
